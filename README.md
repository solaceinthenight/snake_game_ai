## Remarks

### Observations
- 0 games: SnakeAI runs into walls and itself
- 25 games: No progress
- 50 games: No progress (High Score = 3)
- 80 games: SnakeAI starts finding fruit more consistently (High Score = 20)
- 89 games: Significant progress related to SnakeAI's searching algorithm (High Score = 51)
- 300 games: No significant progress (High Score = 64)

### Problems/Limitations
- After 100 games, SnakeAI fails to die to wall boundary; however, SnakeAI runs into itself
- After 300 games, SnakeAI has yet to improve: still runs into itself.
